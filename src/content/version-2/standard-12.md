You must create a service that users find easy to use to meet point 12 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you’ve done this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 12 improves your service

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes [disabled users](https://www.gov.ukhttps://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction) or those who need [assisted digital support](https://www.gov.ukhttps://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/assisted-digital-support-introduction).

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help.

## How you’ll be assessed

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

To pass the alpha, beta and live assessments, you usually need to:

- explain your service and what it does
- show the majority of users of your service are succeeding the first time they try to use it
- explain how you used research, testing and analytics to make substantial iterations to your service, including the assisted digital support model
- explain all end-to-end user journeys, including assisted digital journeys, demonstrate that they work and how you tested them
- explain the design options you’re considering for your assisted digital support
- explain how you’ve designed your assisted digital support model to meet user needs and how you’re providing it - if you’re not providing it by telephone, face-to-face, talk through and on-behalf-of, you must explain why
- explain how your assisted digital support will be sustainably funded and free to users

At the beta and live assessments you also need to:

- show your service is accessible
- explain how you’ve done usability testing, including users with the lowest level of digital skills
- explain what you learned by testing your assisted digital support model
- explain how you made design and content decisions based on user research, usability testing and analytics
- discuss how many rounds of usability testing you’ve done, the users you included, the tasks you set, and the materials you gave them to complete the task
- explain how you’ve changed the interface design in response to usability testing, showing your build, measure, and learn cycles, the hypotheses you tested, what happened and how you reacted

You also need to:

- show how most people can get through the service end-to-end without assistance
- explain how you’ve tested your assisted digital support model (the way you plan to help people who lack the skills, confidence or internet access to complete the service on their own)
- discuss whether your usability testing included the supporting content and proposed start page for the service
- explain how you tested whether the name of your service makes sense to your users
- how you’ve used analytics and user research to reduce dropout rates for your digital service

## Explain your service’s evolution

At each phase you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.
