You must use agile methods to meet point 4 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to discuss how you’ve used agile methods at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 4 improves your service

Using agile methods helps you to build services that:

- meet the needs of your users
- are easy and convenient for people to use
- you can change easily, eg if government policy or technology policy changes
- you can keep improving, eg based on user feedback
- cost less and are more accountable

## How you’ll be assessed

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

To pass the alpha, beta and live assessments, you usually need to:

- explain how you’re working in an agile way, using agile tools and techniques, and how you’ll continue to do so when the service is live
- explain how you and your team have reviewed and iterated the ways you work to fix problems
- explain how your team is using agile tools and techniques to communicate with each other
- give an example of how the team has responded to user research and usability testing
- show that your governance is agile, based on clear and measurable goals, and has a clear focus on managing change and risk in real time

You also need to discuss:

- the design options you explored for your prototype and the reasons you discarded some
- how the design of the service has changed over time because of what you found in user research
- the design options you’re considering for your assisted digital support
- any problems that you found in research which you’ll have to solve to design the service, and how you plan to solve them

## Explain your service’s evolution

At each phase, you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.
