You must make all new source code open to meet point 8 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you’ve done this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 8 improves your service

Making your source code open means:

- other services can reuse the software you’ve created
- other services do not end up doing work you’ve already done and you reduce costs in government as a whole
- you avoid starting technology contracts that you cannot end easily

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

## How you’ll be assessed at alpha

To pass, you usually need to:

- explain how you plan to make all new source code open and reusable
- confirm that you own the intellectual property
- explain how someone else can reuse your code

## How you’ll be assessed at beta

To pass, you usually need to:

- explain how you’re making new source code open and reusable
- show your code in an open internet source code repository
- explain the licences you’re using to release code during beta
- confirm that you own the intellectual property
- explain how a team in another department can reuse your code
- explain how you’re using code from other teams or services

## How you’ll be assessed at live

To pass, you usually need to:

- explain how you’re making new source code open and reusable
- show your code in an open internet source code repository
- describe how you accept contributions and comments on the code
- explain how you’re handling updates and bug fixes to the code
- explain the licences you’re using to release code
- confirm that you own the intellectual property
- explain the code you’ve not made open and why
- explain how a team in another department can reuse your code

## Explain your service’s evolution

At each phase you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.
