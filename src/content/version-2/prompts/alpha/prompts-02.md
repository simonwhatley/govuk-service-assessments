The main objective is to ensure that you have someone on the team who is dedicated to doing the user research, that there are plans to continue doing user research, and that there is evidence that outcomes from the user research will be fed into the ongoing development/design of the service. Responses should cover both digital and assisted digital support.

When doing user research for assisted digital, ensure that research is done specifically with (potential) users of this particular service who have the lowest level of digital skills. Recruitment and research with this audience will need to be done using offline methods.

### Questions

- Are the resources in place to do regular user research and usability testing?
- Who in the team is doing user research and usability testing?
- How often are you doing user research and usability testing?
- How do the results feed into the design of the service?
- What is the user research plan for the next stage and are there resources for user research and usability testing?

### Evidence

User Researcher and/or Service manager able to:

- explain who is doing user research and usability testing and how it is being resourced.
- talk through the research plan for the next stage of the project.
- explain how the results from user research and usability testing are incorporated into the design of the service.
