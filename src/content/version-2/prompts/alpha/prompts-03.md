## Alpha

### Questions

- Can you talk us through your team for alpha?
- How has the service manager been empowered to make decisions during alpha?
- Is the service manager the single responsible person with the power and knowledge to make decisions to improve the service day-to-day during alpha?
- Are there any gaps in the team and how are you addressing these?
- Is there a separation of key roles?
- How will your assisted digital support be sustainably funded and free to the user?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- clearly explain the structure of the team for alpha (the following should be either in the team or available to the team depending on the scale of the service - service manager, product manager, delivery manager, tech architect and lead, assisted digital lead, designer, user researcher, developers, content designer, web ops, performance analyst).
- explain how they are empowered to make decisions during alpha.
- explain where they have gaps in the team and explain how they will address them.
- show that there is a separation of key roles (i.e. the same person is not performing multiple roles within the service).
- there is at least one user researcher working at least 3 days per week.
- explain how you plan to ensure assisted digital support is sustainably funded (including support not delivered by government) and free to the user.
