## Live

### Questions

- Have you changed the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
- Have these metrics changed since beta assessment and if so why?
- How are you measuring the performance of the existing (if applicable) and new service across digital, non-digital and assisted-digital channels?

### Evidence

Using the Performance Platform dashboard, the Service Manager is able to:

- explain and show how they are reporting user satisfaction on their dashboard.
- explain how they are planning to increase user satisfaction after the service goes live.
- explain who will monitor user satisfaction after the service is live.
- explain and show how they are reporting completion rates (or equivalent†) on their dashboard.
- explain how they are planning to increase completion rates after the service goes live.
- explain who will monitor completion rates after the service is live.
- explain and show how they are reporting cost per transaction (or equivalent*) on their dashboard.
- explain how they are planning to achieve a low cost per transaction after the service goes live.
- explain who will monitor cost per transaction after the service is live.
- explain and show how they are reporting digital take up on their dashboard, and - explain how it measures channel shift.
- explain how they are planning to increase digital uptake after the service goes live.
- explain realistic planning to increase digital uptake (thereby reducing reliance on assisted digital) after the service goes live.
- explain who will monitor digital take up after the service is live.
- explain and show other additional metrics supporting the service on their dashboard.
- explain how they are planning to use these metrics to improve the service.
- explain who will monitor these metrics.
- demonstrate that delivery partners and other stakeholders are actively promoting/supporting digital delivery.
- identify future metrics and how they will be used to improve the service.
- outline a timescale when these metrics will be available.
