## Alpha

In the alpha phase, the main objective is to establish whether the team has a good understanding of user needs that has come from observing and engaging with end users, that they understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service (the user context, whether currently digital or not) and they they understand the user needs - not just functional requirements - that the service will have to achieve in order to be successful. Responses should cover both the digital and assisted digital support.

Further, the team need to demonstrate how they have explored design options that will best meet these needs, what concepts they have discarded and why they believe their final prototype has the potential to meet users needs effectively.

The assessors are less interested in the quantity of user research that has been undertaken, but rather in the quality and coverage - was it with the right people, was it the right kind of user research done in the right way/place, has it effectively created a user-centred, empathetic view of the project for the team.

The assessors will be interested in how the team has used mixed methods / sources of data to corroborate key findings (eg mixing analytics data with qualitative research findings).

When doing user research for assisted digital, ensure that research is done specifically with (potential) users of this particular service who have the lowest level of digital skills. Recruitment and research with this audience will need to be done using offline methods.

### Questions

#### Questions about user needs

- Who are the users?
- What have you done to understand your users’ needs?
- Tell us about what users are trying to do when they encounter your service?
- What are the needs that they have when they use this service?
- How do they meet those needs now?
- What are the pain points?
- Which users have the most challenging needs?
- How have you been learning more about these challenging user needs?
- What are the particular design challenges for this service with this audience?
- Tell us about what you’ve learned about the particular needs of people who are less confident online or not online?

#### Questions about the alpha prototype and user needs

- What design options did you explore?
- Why did you discard some?
- Why did you select this one to move forward?
- In the prototype that you have selected can you show you user research has influenced the design of particular elements? (showing iteration over time)
- Which parts of the service have proved most problematic? What solutions have you been exploring to solve these problems?
- What design options are you considering for your assisted digital support and why?

### Evidence

It is very useful to include your user researcher in the team presenting at the assessment to answer assessor’s questions.

The user researcher and/or service manager should be able to answer questions from the assessment panel by showing and referring to some or all of these artefacts of user research (for the onscreen service and assisted digital support), which include:

- User research output of discovery that describes how users (including assisted digital users) are currently meeting the needs that this service will meet, (e.g. a customer journey map or user needs map), key pain points in the current journey and description of the user research that has informed this output.
- Stories of people you have met, persona, profiles or some other way of telling the stories of the users (including assisted digital users) who will be using this service in the future.
- The user needs you have identified for this service, including any specific needs of assisted digital users.
- Any key insights you have gained from the research that describes significant service design challenges for this project to overcome.

## Beta

In the beta phase, the main purpose is to establish that the team has continued to build the service in a way that meets user needs, and this has been done in a way that makes the service easy for all users. We are particularly looking to see that findings from the user research are reflected in the design of the service as it progresses through this phase. Responses should cover both digital and assisted digital support.

#### Questions about usability

- How many rounds of usability testing have you done so far?
- Who have you done usability testing with?
- What were the tasks you set for participants and what materials did you supply to help them complete the task (if relevant).
- GIve us some specific examples of how aspects of the interface design has changed in each iteration in response to usability testing? (Show us your build/measure/learn cycles, what hypotheses did you test? what happened? what did you do?)
- Can most people get through the service end-to-end without assistance?
- Which users have the most challenging needs?
- How have you been learning more about these challenging user needs?
- Have you started testing methods for supporting people who do need assistance to get through the service?
- Who have you done this testing with and what were your findings?
- Has your testing included the supporting content and proposed start page for the service?
- What issues have you not yet resolved? What are your hypotheses around how you might solve those issues? How will you test that?
- What issues are you unable to test/resolve in beta thus far? How are you going to handle that as you move into public beta?
- Have you tested whether the name of the service makes sense to your users?

- your research schedule for beta thus far (who you did research with, when and where, including assisted digital users).
- user research videos and accompanying user research analysis outputs for recent sprints.
- examples showing how the design of various elements in the service have changed from iteration to iteration in response to user research.
- findings from user research undertaken for assisted digital support, with potential assisted digital users of the specific service, with the lowest level of digital skills, confidence and access and through offline methods.

## Live

In the beta phase the main purpose is to establish that the team has continued to build out the service in a way that meets user needs, that this has been done in a way that makes the service easy for all users. We are particularly looking to see that findings from the user research are reflected in the design of the service as it has progressed through this phase. Responses should cover both digital and assisted digital support.
