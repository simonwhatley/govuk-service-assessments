## Alpha

In the alpha phase, the main objective is to establish whether the team has a good understanding of user needs that has come from observing and engaging with end users, that they understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service (the user context, whether currently digital or not) and they they understand the user needs - not just functional requirements - that the service will have to achieve in order to be successful. Responses should cover both the digital and assisted digital support.

Further, the team need to demonstrate how they have explored design options that will best meet these needs, what concepts they have discarded and why they believe their final prototype has the potential to meet users needs effectively.

The assessors are less interested in the quantity of user research that has been undertaken, but rather in the quality and coverage - was it with the right people, was it the right kind of user research done in the right way/place, has it effectively created a user-centred, empathetic view of the project for the team.

The assessors will be interested in how the team has used mixed methods / sources of data to corroborate key findings (eg mixing analytics data with qualitative research findings).

When doing user research for assisted digital, ensure that research is done specifically with (potential) users of this particular service who have the lowest level of digital skills. Recruitment and research with this audience will need to be done using offline methods.

### Questions

#### Questions about user needs

- Who are the users?
- What have you done to understand your users’ needs?
- Tell us about what users are trying to do when they encounter your service?
- What are the needs that they have when they use this service?
- How do they meet those needs now?
- What are the pain points?
- Which users have the most challenging needs?
- How have you been learning more about these challenging user needs?
- What are the particular design challenges for this service with this audience?
- Tell us about what you’ve learned about the particular needs of people who are less confident online or not online?

#### Questions about the alpha prototype and user needs

- What design options did you explore?
- Why did you discard some?
- Why did you select this one to move forward?
- In the prototype that you have selected can you show you user research has influenced the design of particular elements? (showing iteration over time)
- Which parts of the service have proved most problematic? What solutions have you been exploring to solve these problems?
- What design options are you considering for your assisted digital support and why?

### Evidence

It is very useful to include your user researcher in the team presenting at the assessment to answer assessor’s questions.

The user researcher and/or service manager should be able to answer questions from the assessment panel by showing and referring to some or all of these artefacts of user research (for the onscreen service and assisted digital support), which include:

- User research output of discovery that describes how users (including assisted digital users) are currently meeting the needs that this service will meet, (e.g. a customer journey map or user needs map), key pain points in the current journey and description of the user research that has informed this output.
- Stories of people you have met, persona, profiles or some other way of telling the stories of the users (including assisted digital users) who will be using this service in the future.
- The user needs you have identified for this service, including any specific needs of assisted digital users.
- Any key insights you have gained from the research that describes significant service design challenges for this project to overcome.
