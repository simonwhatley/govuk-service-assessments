## Alpha

The main objective is to ensure that you have someone on the team who is dedicated to doing the user research, that there are plans to continue doing user research, and that there is evidence that outcomes from the user research will be fed into the ongoing development/design of the service. Responses should cover both digital and assisted digital support.

When doing user research for assisted digital, ensure that research is done specifically with (potential) users of this particular service who have the lowest level of digital skills. Recruitment and research with this audience will need to be done using offline methods.

### Questions

- Are the resources in place to do regular user research and usability testing?
- Who in the team is doing user research and usability testing?
- How often are you doing user research and usability testing?
- How do the results feed into the design of the service?
- What is the user research plan for the next stage and are there resources for user research and usability testing?

### Evidence

User Researcher and/or Service manager able to:

- explain who is doing user research and usability testing and how it is being resourced.
- talk through the research plan for the next stage of the project.
- explain how the results from user research and usability testing are incorporated into the design of the service.

## Beta

Responses should cover both digital and assisted digital support.

When doing user research for assisted digital, ensure that research is done specifically with (potential) users of this particular service who have the lowest level of digital skills. Recruitment and research with this audience will need to be done using offline methods.

Accessibility testing with people who have particular access needs should be done throughout the service design process and not outsourced as a separate activity at the end of the design process.

### Questions

- Are the resources in place to do regular user research and usability testing?
- Who in the team is doing user research and usability testing?
- How often are you doing user research and usability testing?
- Are you testing with a full range of end users, including those with low or no ability to use the digital service?
- Are you doing regular usability testing with people who have particular access needs (accessibility testing)?
- How is the analytics data feeding into the research plan for the service?
- How do the results feed into the design of the service?
- What is the user research plan for the next stage and are there resources for user research and usability testing?

### Evidence

User Researcher and/or Service manager able to:

- talk through the plan to ensure the research covers the full range of end users including accessibility and assisted digital users.
- explain how the results from user research and usability testing are incorporated into the design of the service.
