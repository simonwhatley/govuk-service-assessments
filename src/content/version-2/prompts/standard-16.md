## Alpha

### Questions

- Have you identified the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
- How are you measuring the performance of the existing service (if applicable) across digital, non-digital and assisted digital channels?
- Have you identified which new or existing (if applicable) measures will form the basis of the new service baseline?
- Have you identified (in addition to the 4 mandatory KPI’s) other measures for the new service and where the data will be provided from?
- Have you investigated how the service is expected to perform in comparison with similar services?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- demonstrate how they currently measure the performance of the existing service (if applicable) and which measures will provide a baseline for the new service and why they have been chosen.
- explain measures for the new service, including dependent transactions (e.g. authentication, search etc), and why they have been chosen.
- identify where the data for the metrics will come from.
- explain their plan and scope for measuring cost per transaction (or equivalent†).
- explain how user satisfaction data will captured, and the choice of benchmark.
- explain how completion rate (or equivalent*) data will be captured, and the choice of benchmark, including the selection of start and end point and eligibility and transaction stages.
- explain how usage volumes for the existing (if applicable) and new services (across channels) are or will be measured and how usage trends and insights drawn from similar services are informing their digital take-up plans.
- explain their plan or benchmark for each additional metric identified for the new service.
- demonstrate they have registered the service with the performance platform and validated that the platform can support the metrics the service dashboard should present.

## Beta

### Questions

- Have you identified the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
- Have these metrics changed since alpha review, and if so why?
- How are you measuring the performance of the existing (if applicable) and beta service across digital, non-digital and assisted-digital channels?
- How are you capturing user journey data for the new service during beta?
- How are you collecting cost per transaction (or equivalent†) data during beta?
- How are you collecting usage volume or digital take up data during beta?
- How are you collecting cost per transaction (or equivalent*) data during beta?
- How are you collecting other identified metrics data during beta?
- How are data analytics and user research being used to identify percentage of users who could channel shift and who will need assisted digital services?
- What are their plans for engaging with service users, delivery partners or other stakeholders during the beta phase?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- explain changes to the metrics collected since alpha and the reasons for change (if any).
- show how they currently measure the performance of the existing service (if applicable) and which measures will provide a baseline for the new service.
- show how they are collecting users journey data for the new service during beta (using a chosen analytics package).
- show how they are collecting and calculating cost per transaction (or equivalent*) during beta.
- show how they are collecting user satisfaction data during beta (GOV.UK ‘done page’ questionnaire or other).
- show how they are collecting completion rate (or equivalent†) data during beta.
- show how they are collecting other metrics data (including journey stage information) during beta.
- explain how they plan to increase digital take up during beta.
- explain how they are assessing potential for channel shift and level of assisted digital services required.
- explain how they are engaging with beta users, delivery partners and other stakeholders to manage transition to live service.
- explain how they will track migration from online to offline.
