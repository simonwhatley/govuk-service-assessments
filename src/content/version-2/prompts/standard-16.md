## Alpha

### Questions

- Have you identified the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
- How are you measuring the performance of the existing service (if applicable) across digital, non-digital and assisted digital channels?
- Have you identified which new or existing (if applicable) measures will form the basis of the new service baseline?
- Have you identified (in addition to the 4 mandatory KPIâ€™s) other measures for the new service and where the data will be provided from?
- Have you investigated how the service is expected to perform in comparison with similar services?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- demonstrate how they currently measure the performance of the existing service (if applicable) and which measures will provide a baseline for the new service and why they have been chosen.
- explain measures for the new service, including dependent transactions (e.g. authentication, search etc), and why they have been chosen.
- identify where the data for the metrics will come from.
- explain their plan and scope for measuring cost per transaction (or equivalent*).
- explain how user satisfaction data will captured, and the choice of benchmark.
- explain how completion rate (or equivalent*) data will be captured, and the choice of benchmark, including the selection of start and end point and eligibility and transaction stages.
- explain how usage volumes for the existing (if applicable) and new services (across channels) are or will be measured and how usage trends and insights drawn from similar services are informing their digital take-up plans.
- explain their plan or benchmark for each additional metric identified for the new service.
- demonstrate they have registered the service with the performance platform and validated that the platform can support the metrics the service dashboard should present.
