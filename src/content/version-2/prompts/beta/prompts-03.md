## Beta

### Questions

- Can you talk us through the team that was in place during alpha and what the team looks like in beta?
- How was the service manager empowered to make decisions during alpha and is this the case in beta?
- Can you give us an example?
- Is the service manager the single responsible person with the power and knowledge to make decisions to improve the service day-to-day during beta?
- Were there any gaps in the team during alpha and how are you addressing these in beta?
- Are you using external people and if so, how are you approaching transferring skills and knowledge to the team during beta?
- Is there a separation of key roles?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- clearly explain the structure of the team during alpha and beta (the following should be either in the team or available to the team depending on the scale of the service - service manager, product manager, delivery manager, tech architect and lead, assisted digital lead, designer, user researcher, developers, content designer, web ops, product analyst).
- show they were empowered to make decisions during alpha and are continuing to do so during beta.
- show there are no gaps in the team or explain how they are addressing any gaps in beta.
- explain how they will transfer knowledge from external people to the team during beta.
- show that there is a separation of key roles (i.e. the same person is not performing multiple roles within the service).
- show there is at least one user researcher working at least 3 days per week.
