## Beta

### Questions

- Have you identified the behaviour, characteristics and dependencies of the new service and the factors that influence the choice of metrics and data sources for those metrics?
- Have these metrics changed since alpha review, and if so why?
- How are you measuring the performance of the existing (if applicable) and beta service across digital, non-digital and assisted-digital channels?
- How are you capturing user journey data for the new service during beta?
- How are you collecting cost per transaction (or equivalent†) data during beta?
- How are you collecting usage volume or digital take up data during beta?
- How are you collecting cost per transaction (or equivalent*) data during beta?
- How are you collecting other identified metrics data during beta?
- How are data analytics and user research being used to identify percentage of users who could channel shift and who will need assisted digital services?
- What are their plans for engaging with service users, delivery partners or other stakeholders during the beta phase?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- explain changes to the metrics collected since alpha and the reasons for change (if any).
- show how they currently measure the performance of the existing service (if applicable) and which measures will provide a baseline for the new service.
- show how they are collecting users journey data for the new service during beta (using a chosen analytics package).
- show how they are collecting and calculating cost per transaction (or equivalent†) during beta.
- show how they are collecting user satisfaction data during beta (GOV.UK ‘done page’ questionnaire or other).
- show how they are collecting completion rate (or equivalent†) data during beta.
- show how they are collecting other metrics data (including journey stage information) during beta.
- explain how they plan to increase digital take up during beta.
- explain how they are assessing potential for channel shift and level of assisted digital services required.
- explain how they are engaging with beta users, delivery partners and other stakeholders to manage transition to live service.
- explain how they will track migration from online to offline.
