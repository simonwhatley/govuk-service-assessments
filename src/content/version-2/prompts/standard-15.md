## Alpha

### Questions

- What data and analysis have you done during discovery from existing or legacy systems or the wider digital landscape?
- What analysis have you made on the alpha?
- Who in the team is responsible for analysis during the alpha, including for assisted digital support?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- explain what data sources and analysis were undertaken in discovery.
- explain how the shape of the service has influenced the choice of metrics, data points and data sources.
- explain who in the team is responsible for identifying actionable data insights during alpha, including assisted digital support.
- talk clearly about evidence from qualitative and quantitative data, what they learned from these sources and what changes to user needs/improvements they identified.
- talk through how these were prioritised and what features were changed or implemented.

## Beta

### Questions

- What have you instrumented and why? Have you modelled user journeys, and are you able to track progression through your service so you can identify completions and areas of poor performance?
- Where appropriate, have you built a funnel, exit paths?
- What tools are you using to collect data?
- Has the SIRO signed these off?
- Where appropriate, have you anonymised the user IP address, have you opted out of data sharing with 3rd parties?
- What analysis has been carried out on the service so far and how has this impacted on the backlog?
- What is the ongoing roadmap for performance analysis, including performance of assisted digital support?
- Who in the team is responsible for identifying actionable data insights, including for assisted digital support?
- What is the next performance analysis user story?
- Have you started discussions with GOV.UK about start and end pages?

- explain the choice of analysis tools used in the beta (and alpha if appropriate).
- show that appropriate information security and privacy issues have been addressed.
- explain how they have modelled user journeys and will track progression through the service so they can identify completions and areas of poor performance in the beta.
- talk clearly about evidence from qualitative and quantitative data, what they learned from these sources and what changes to user needs/improvements they identified.
- talk through how these were prioritised and what features were changed or implemented.
- talk about the ongoing roadmap for performance analysis, and explain who in the team is responsible for identifying actionable data insights during the beta, including for assisted digital support.
