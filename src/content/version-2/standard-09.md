You must use open standards and common platforms to meet point 9 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you’ve done this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 9 improves your service

Using open standards and common government platforms means you:

- save time and money by reusing things that are already available, such as GOV.UK Verify for identity assurance
- can move between different technologies when you need to and do not get locked into contracts which are difficult to end
- can quickly and easily change your service when you need to
- can give your users a more consistent experience when using government services online - this builds trust

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

## How you’ll be assessed at alpha

To pass your alpha assessment, you usually need to explain how you:

- use open standards and common platforms to avoid getting locked into contracts
- use common platforms for your system, such as GOV.UK Verify as an option for identity assurance
- identify the common user needs your service meets and what you reuse from across government to help meet those user needs

## How you’ll be assessed at beta

To pass your beta assessment, you usually need to explain how you:

- use open standards and common platforms to avoid getting locked into contracts
- manage what the service outputs to users is and in what format
- manage common data you hold and your commitment to publishing it
- use common government platforms, such as GOV.UK Verify as an option for identity assurance
- integrate with any legacy systems
- identify the common user needs your service meets and what you reuse from across government to help meet those user needs

## How you’ll be assessed at live

To pass your live assessment, you usually need to explain how you:

- use open standards and common platforms to avoid getting locked into contracts
- use common government platforms, such as GOV.UK Verify as an option for identity assurance
- integrate with any external systems
- manage the common data you hold and meet your open data responsibility
- identify the common user needs your service meets and what you reuse from across government to help meet those user needs

## Explain your service’s evolution

At each phase, you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.
