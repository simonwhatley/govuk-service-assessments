You must make the user experience consistent with GOV.UK to meet point 13 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you’ve done this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 13 improves your service

Using the same language and design patterns as the rest of GOV.UK means:

- users trust GOV.UK services because they recognise the style
- you do not have to build something entirely new so you save time and can focus on unique parts of your service
- you’re using patterns and style which are based on data and user research

## How you’ll be assessed

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

To pass your alpha, beta, and live assessments you usually need to:

- explain how your team has included designers, content designers and frontend developers
- explain how the service has used the styles, components and patterns in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) or the GOV.UK frontend toolkit and elements

To pass the beta and live assessments you also need to show:

- the service is responsive and works on mobile devices
- the headers and footers match the GOV.UK style
- you’ve got a start and end page on GOV.UK and that both are optimised for users

## Explain your service’s evolution

At each phase, you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.
