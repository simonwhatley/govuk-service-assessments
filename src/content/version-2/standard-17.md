You must report your performance data to meet point 17 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you did this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 17 improves your service

The Performance Platform collects your service’s data and presents it in a consistent, structured and easily digestible format - this helps you to:

- make quick, data-driven decisions about how to improve your service
- compare data across multiple government services
- be open and transparent to the public about your service’s performance

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

At each phase you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.

## How you’ll be assessed at alpha

To pass you usually need to show you’ve:

- registered your service with the Performance Platform
- checked that it can support the metrics you want to present on your dashboard

## How you’ll be assessed at beta

To pass you usually need to show:

- your beta dashboard with baseline data, explain your audience for beta and describe how you’ve been using the dashboard during beta
- the metrics that are uploading to the Performance Platform and whether they’re being uploaded manually or automatically
- your published performance dashboard

## How you’ll be assessed at live

To pass, you usually need to:

- show your published Performance Platform dashboard, including metrics for the 4 key performance indicators (KPIs), and other metrics
- explain what your other key metrics are and why you’ve chosen them

## Explain your service’s evolution
