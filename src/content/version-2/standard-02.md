You must do ongoing user research to meet point 2 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you’ve done this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## How point 2 improves your service

Doing ongoing user research means you can:

- check your service is helping users to do the tasks they need to do
- keep improving the service based on users’ needs

Your assessment and the questions the assessors ask you will vary depending on your service and what it does.

## How you’ll be assessed at alpha

To pass the alpha assessment, you usually need to show:

- what your private beta will look like and how you’ll use what you find to improve the service
- you can pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it’s built
- how often you’ll carry out research and usability tests and how you’ll use the results to improve the design of your service
- a user research plan for private beta and a plan for carrying out user research on the live service

## How you’ll be assessed at beta and live

To pass the beta and live assessments, you usually need to show:

- you can pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and you’ll be able to pay after the service is built
- how often you’ll carry out research and usability tests and how the results will affect the way you design the service
- a user research plan for the service at the next phase and a plan for carrying out user research on the live service
- how you’ve done user research with people who have accessibility needs from the time you started designing the service
- how you’ve tested with users who need assisted digital support
- how you’re using analytics data in your user research plan for the service
- any problems you’ve found through testing and how you solved them
- any problems you have not been able to solve in beta and how you’ll handle them in public beta

## Explain your service’s evolution

At each phase, you should explain how your service has evolved since its last assessment.
