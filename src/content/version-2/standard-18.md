You must test your service with the minister to meet point 18 of the Digital Service Standard.

You’ll have to explain how you did this at your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work).

## Why you must test with the minister

Ministers are accountable for everything produced by their departments, so you need to show them your service before it goes live.

## How you’ll be assessed at alpha

To pass the alpha assessment, you need to confirm that the minister responsible for the service will test it before it goes live.

## How you’ll be assessed at beta

To pass the beta assessment you need to explain how you’ll test the service with the minister responsible for it.

## How you’ll be assessed at live

To pass the live assessment, you need to show evidence (a video, photos or a signed letter) that the minister responsible for the service has tested the full service from beginning to end, including any legacy or offline parts.
