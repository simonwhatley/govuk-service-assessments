The launch of a service on GOV.UK is only the beginning. Once it has been released, users become the arbiters of its quality. Having designed the service to be iteratively developed using performance data and user research, service teams will have all the tools and techniques they need to continuously improve what they offer. Performance against the 4 key indicators will be tracked and publicly displayed.

To keep to the standard, your team must:

- [continuously update and improve the service](/version-1/guides/continuous-delivery/) on the basis of user feedback, performance data, changes to best practice and service demand
- contribute to best practice developed across government to be shared through the service manual
- show high levels of [user satisfaction](/version-1/guides/user-satisfaction/) are maintained in the digital and assisted digital service
- show high levels of [transaction completion](/version-1/guides/completion-rate/) are maintained in the digital and assisted digital service
- show [cost per transaction](/version-1/guides/cost-per-transaction/) is decreasing in line with plans submitted ahead of the service’s launch
- show [digital take-up](/version-1/guides/digital-take-up/) is [increasing in line with plans](https://web.archive.org/web/20150505160928/https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communications/increasing-digital-takeup.html) submitted ahead of the service’s launch, and [assisted digital support](/version-1/guides/assisted-digital/) is targeted at the people who really need it
- make all new source code open, reusable and publish it under appropriate licenses (or else give a convincing explanation of why this can’t be done for specific subsets of the source code)
