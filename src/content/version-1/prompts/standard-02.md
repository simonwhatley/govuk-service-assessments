- Can you talk us through your team for the alpha?
- Is the service manager empowered to make decisions during the alpha?
- Do you have confirmation of this from above?
- Is the service manager the single responsible person with the power and knowledge to make decisions to improve the service day to day during the alpha?
- Are there any gaps in the team and how are you addressing these?
- Is there a separation of key roles?
