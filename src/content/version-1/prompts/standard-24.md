## Alpha

### Questions

- Have you made contact with the performance platform?
- How are you measuring the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service?
- Have you heard about stageprompt (or an equivalent event tracking)?
- Tell us about your plan to increase digital take up?
- How do current digital take up levels for your service compare with those of similar services?
- How are you measuring the performance of the service across all existing channels (This will provide a baseline for the new service)?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- show they have made contact with the performance platform and understand the role of stageprompt (or an equivalent event tracking) in getting their completion rate data on their performance dashboard
- explain how they currently measure the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service
- explain their plan for increasing digital take-up
- explain how they measure the usage volumes for the current service(across channels) and - explain how this information will be made available to Performance Platform team.
- explain how usage trends and insights drawn from similar services are informing their digital take-up plans

## Beta

### Questions

- How are you measuring the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service?
- Have you installed stageprompt (or equivalent event tracking)?
- How will you collect user satisfaction data during the beta?
- How will you collect completion rate data during the beta?
- How will you collect cost per transaction data during the beta?
- How will you collect digital take up data during the beta?
- Tell us about your plan to increase digital take up during the beta?
- What data is being collected, how they are collecting it, and is it being shared with performance platform?
- How are data analytics and user research being used to identify % of users who could channel shift and who will need assisted digital services?
- What are their plans for engaging with service users, delivery partners or other stakeholders during the beta phase?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- explain how they will collect user satisfaction data during the beta (through the standard questionnaire on the GOV.UK done page)
- explain how they currently measure the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service
Show they have installed stageprompt (or equivalent event tracking)
- explain how they will collect completion rate data during the beta
- explain how they will collect cost per transaction data during the beta
- explain how they will collect digital take up data during the beta
- explain how they currently measure the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service
- explain how they plan to increase digital take up during the beta
- how they are assessing potential for channel shift and level of assisted digital services required
- how they are engaging with beta users, delivery partners and other stakeholders to manage transition to live service how they will track migration from online to offline

## Live

### Questions

- Can you show us how you are reporting user satisfaction on your dashboard?
- How are you planning to increase user satisfaction after the service goes live?
- How are you measuring the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service?
- Can you show us how you are reporting completion rates on your dashboard?
- How are you planning to increase completion rates after the service goes live?
- Can you show us how you are reporting cost per transaction on your dashboard?
- How are you planning to achieve a low cost per transaction after the service goes live?
- Can you show us how you are reporting digital take up on your dashboard, and does it demonstrate channel shift is taking place?
- What are your plans and (year on year) targets for increasing digital uptake after the service goes live?
- How are you measuring the performance of the old service to provide a baseline for the new service?
- Are your delivery partners and other stakeholders promoting your digital service?
