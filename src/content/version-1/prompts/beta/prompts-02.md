### Questions

- Can you talk us through the team that was in place during the alpha and what the team will look like for the beta?
- Was the service manager empowered to make decisions during the alpha and will this remain be the case for the beta?
- Can you give us an example?
- Is the service manager the single responsible person with the power and knowledge to make decisions to improve the service day to day during the beta?
- Were there any gaps in the team during the alpha and how are you addressing these for the beta?
- How much help have you had from GDS and how are you transferring skills and knowledge to the team during the beta?
- Are you using external people and if so, how are you approaching transferring skills and knowledge to the team during the beta?
- Is there a separation of key roles?

### Evidence

Service Manager able to:

- clearly explain the structure of the team during the alpha and for the beta (the following should be either in the team or available to the team depending on the scale of the service - service manager, product manager, delivery manager, tech lead, assisted digital lead, designer, user researcher, developers, content designer, technical architect, web ops, product analyst)
- show they were empowered to make decisions during the alpha and will continue to do during the beta
- show there are no gaps in the team or explain how they will address any gaps in the beta
- explain how they will transfer skills and knowledge to the team during the beta (where they have had help from GDS)
- explain how they will transfer knowledge from external people to the team during the beta
- show that there is a separation of key roles (i.e. the same person is not performing multiple roles within the service)
- show there is at least one user researcher working at least 3 days per week
