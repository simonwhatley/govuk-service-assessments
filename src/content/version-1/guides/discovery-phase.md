title: Discovery phase
subtitle: Find out what your users need, what to measure and what your constraints are
description: |
  What are the [needs of your users](/version-1/guides/user-needs/)? What services currently meet those? How are they [performing](/version-1/guides/performance-platform/)? What technological or policy related constraints might there be?

Before you start building a service you need to build up a picture of what the context for that service is. That means lots of [user research](/version-1/guides/user-research/index.html), close analysis of policies, laws and business needs, and workshops and interviews which establish the criteria for success of your service.

## Objectives

[Watch Aleks Maricic, GDS Proposition Manager, describe the discovery phase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVX1BT0oxWU)

The discovery phase will give you a high-level understanding of [user needs](/version-1/guides/user-needs/), what the existing service landscape looks like and a sense of what your [initial prototypes](/version-1/guides/working-with-prototypes/) will explore.

You’ll need to think about user needs for digital and assisted digital users. As a start, you’ll need to understand [what proportion of your users you think will need assisted digital support](/version-1/guides/assisted-digital-action-plan/#discovery-stage).

The high-level business context will become clear, and you’ll begin setting targets for [your KPIs](/version-1/guides/measurement/).

You’ll also get a better understanding of the legacy interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing process are in place for [replacing or decommissioning these](/version-1/guides/retirement-phase/).

This information is found through:

- workshops
- simple mock ups
- paper prototypes
- plenty of whiteboard diagrams

## The team

[A small team will be required](/version-1/guides/the-team/), consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the [service manager](/version-1/guides/service-manager/).

# Timescales

The phase should not take longer than 4 to 8 weeks. During the final week you should be setting up the broad scope of a project and an initial set of [user stories](/version-1/guides/writing-user-stories/) (also known as a backlog) to work to. This is known as an ‘inception’. At the end of the phase a decision should be made whether to proceed to the [alpha phase](/version-1/guides/alpha-phase/).

## Outputs

You will leave the discovery phase with:

- a prioritised list of [user needs](/version-1/guides/user-needs.html)
- a prioritised list of [story cards](/version-1/guides/writing-user-stories/) to feed into project teams
- understanding of [team](/version-1/guides/the-team/) and capability required to complete the project
- ability to scope and plan an [alpha](/version-1/guides/alpha-phase/)
- a decision to progress to next phase
- maybe some rough prototypes
- maybe some user personas
- a list of stakeholders and input from them about existing services
- understanding of existing services, including those run by non-government sources
- understanding of how many of your users will need assisted digital support, and what their user needs are
