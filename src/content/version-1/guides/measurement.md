Do this by monitoring your metrics. Your metrics are a way to start discussing the strengths and weaknesses of your service, and will help your team to find ways of improving your service over time.

## What you will measure

The [digital by default service standard](/version-1/) states 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) which should be used to measure the success of your service:

- [cost per transaction](/version-1/guides/cost-per-transaction/)
- [user satisfaction](/version-1/guides/user-satisfaction/)
- [completion rate](/version-1/guides/completion-rate/)
- [digital take-up](/version-1/guides/digital-takeup/)

These aren’t the only things your service should measure. Identify unique indicators to your service to help judge its effectiveness. Read our [guidance on establishing KPIs specific to your service](/version-1/guides/other-metrics/).

## What happens to your data

Once live, the performance of your service will be monitored and displayed on the [Performance Platform](/version-1/guides/performance-platform.html). This data will be presented in modules capable of being uniquely configured, and (where possible) will be visible to the public.

Use this data to [investigate how well a service is performing, and as a prompt for further investigation and testing](https://web.archive.org/web/20150325180159/https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/using-data.html).
