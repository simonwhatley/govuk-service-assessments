Occasionally, digital services will need paper forms at some stage in the transaction. Sometimes an application may require one or more ‘wet signatures’ to validate it, or print alternatives may be part of your [assisted digital](/version-1/guides/assisted-digital/) support.

For the most part you can approach these as design challenges like any other – the [Design Principles](https://web.archive.org/web/20150324140521/https://www.gov.uk/design-principles) are a great way to start this work – but there are some specific things you’ll want to bear in mind.

## Don’t make paper forms unless you have to

The most important thing to remember is that print forms should only be made when absolutely necessary.

For example, the legislation governing Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) requires ‘wet signatures’ for the application to be valid. Until this legislation changes, a print form has to be part of the final service.

## Do as much as possible online

Aim for as much of the transaction as possible to be completed online. Users should have to print as little as possible in order to complete an application, which means:

- getting rid of any duplication
- pre-populating forms with information entered online
- making sure a user only prints the forms they require
- eliminating unnecessary steps and fields (if a field is marked as optional, consider whether you need to collect that information at all)

## Start from scratch

In lots of cases, paper forms will exist for services being redesigned. The launch of the digital service gives you an opportunity to improve them. When doing so, don’t just base your designs on the existing forms. Look at what information you need to carry out the transaction and try to eliminate unnecessary steps.

Performance data should be available for the existing forms. This will tell you about the most common options people select and the kinds of mistakes they make. This will be useful information while you design the new forms.

## The context of a form may be other forms (not the web)

Links, smart answers, search boxes and drop downs are not available in print publications. If a transaction requires multiple forms you will need to make sure the design and layout helps users navigate them as easily as their online counterparts.

In the Lasting Power of Attorney application forms, this meant:

- numbering the forms so it was clear in which order they needed to be completed
- clearly indicating when questions are optional (‘skip this question if…’)
- improving the forms in response to user testing
- giving an overview of the application process at the start
- labelling pages and continuation sheets clearly
- explaining jargon inline

## Digital to paper and back to digital again

Your paper forms are a small but important part of a digital process. Typically you’ll be switching to paper forms to collect a signature.

There are some ways you can make this transition easier:

- add familiarity by showing some of the information the user has just entered in large font – their name, for example
- create a transcript of the information entered using the digital tool, with a signature box at the bottom.
- if your digital output has to match an existing paper form, you can still add a cover sheet with user’s input (for familiarity)
- clearly explain the next step: for example, give the address to send the form to, or give a web address to continue using the digital tool; if you give a URL, include a short ID string which logs the user in and takes them to the relevant step
- the digital and paper counterparts should have a similar look and feel

## Test your forms with real users

You should test your paper forms with real users. For complex forms, plan for 3 rounds of [lab testing](/version-1/guides/lab-based-user-testing/), making improvements to the form between each round.

You’ll gain valuable insight by attending the user research in person.

## If you have to choose between hiring a writer and a designer, choose a writer

[Templates](#templates-and-examples) (based on the Lasting Power of Attorney application) created by teams across government will help you make easy-to-complete forms, but lots of the ‘heavy-lifting’ will be in making specialist terms and language accessible to the majority of users.

Where specialist terms are unavoidable, or necessary, you’ll need people who understand [how users read](/version-1/guides/how-users-read/) and how best to [write for government services](https://web.archive.org/web/20150324140521/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) when working on the design.

Skilled content designers and copywriters will make forms – whether online or in print – simpler and clearer, improving the [completion rate](/version-1/guides/completion-rate/) and [user satisfaction](/version-1/guides/user-satisfaction/) in the process.

## Forms are not an alternative channel

They complement the digital transaction and should be easy to process by staff supporting the digital service.

Their performance also has an impact on the [KPIs you gather for digital services](/version-1/guides/measurement/).

We can send you the LPA form pack to use as a template. (The redesigned LPA forms will be made public soon by the Ministry of Justice as part of a formal consultation.)
