The Digital by Default Service Standard is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality. This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs.

The standard:

- needs to be met by all new or redesigned transactional government services going live after April 2014
- has to be maintained after a government service has gone live
- aims to make digital services so good that people prefer to carry out the transaction online rather than by phone, post or in person

The service manual will help digital teams meet the standard and select people with the skills they need.

If a Government Digital Service assessment panel doesn’t pass a service, it won’t be awarded the standard and won’t appear on GOV.UK.

The Digital by Default Service Standard was a commitment the government made in its Digital Strategy.

Teams must meet the criteria below, and maintain this quality for the full life of their service.
